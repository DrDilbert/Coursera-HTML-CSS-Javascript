              <h2>Chicken</h2>
              <p>
                The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. 
                Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated 
                is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period 
                (4th–2nd centuries BC).Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) 
                and as pets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,
                up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural 
                references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

                He's got a beef with everyone in the room.
                He's got beef over what you said.

              <h2>Sushi</h2>
              <p>
                Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a 
                variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, 
                but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.             
              </p>
              <p>
                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types 
                of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or 
                pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
