              <h2>Chicken</h2>
              <p>
                According to Wikipedia, the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. 
                Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated 
                is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period 
                (4th–2nd centuries BC).Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) 
                and as pets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,
                up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural 
                references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature. 
              </p>
              <p>
                According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a 
                euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock", and is widely used throughout North America. 
                "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.

            <h2>Beef</h2>
              <p>
                According to wordsense.eu to Beef (verb) means "to complain," (slang).
              </p>
              <p>
                It means a grudge; a dislike (of something or someone); a lack of faith or trust (in something or someone); 
                a reason for a dislike or grudge:
                He's got a beef with everyone in the room.
                He's got beef over what you said.
                Remember what happened last fall? That's his beef with me. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Accordint to Wikipedia, the word beef is from the Latin bōs, in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words 
                have the same Indo-European root) After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England 
                naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served. 
              <p>
                Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used for 
                the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox) 
                (Modern French bœuf) by the French nobles — who did not often deal with the live animal — when it was served to 
                them. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  This is one example of the common English dichotomy between the words for animals (with largely Germanic 
                origins) and their meat (with Romanic origins) that is also found in such English word-pairs as pig/pork, 
                deer/venison, sheep/mutton and chicken/poultry (also the less common goat/chevon).Beef is cognate with 
                bovine through the Late Latin bovīnus. The rarely used plural form of beef is beeves.

              <h2>Sushi</h2>
              <p>
                According to Wikipedia, Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a 
                variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, 
                but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.             
              </p>
              <p>
                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types 
                of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or 
                pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, 
                where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring". There is an earlier 
                mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the
                 journal Notes and Queries.
