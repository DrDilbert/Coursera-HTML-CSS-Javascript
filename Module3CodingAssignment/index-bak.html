                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>
                    The game of chicken, also known as the hawkâ€“dove game or snowdrift game, is a model 
                    of conflict for two players in game theory. The principle of the game is that while 
                    the ideal outcome is for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither 
                    yields), the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for not wanting to look like 
                    a 'chicken'. So each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. 
                    However, when one player yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game is for the 
                    most part over.

                <p>
                    Beef began its life as an intransitive verb in 1888 and soon took on the noun meaning 
                    in 1899 appearing in such expressions as "What's your beef? and "I had a beef with him" 
                    (not a steak).</p>

                <p>
                    Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
                    accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables.
